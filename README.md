<p>FCBarcelona is a football (soccer) team based on the Catalonian capital of Barcelona, Spain. It's home to not only the team but the fans who are known as Culers. It was founded in 1899 and has a lot of history in the footballing world, producing talents such as the GOAT of football, the one and only Lionel Messi. When someone brings up the idea of football, FC Barcelona is sure to be included in the topic as it is (in my opinion) the world's best team. <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/">| FC Barcelona Website |</a></p>

<p>At a very young age, I fell in love with the sport of football. As everyone person finds their team to support, I found mine instantly. It was non other than FC Barcelona. Not only did I find a team that I would support my whole life, I found the person who inspired me the most. Lionel Messi is my biggest inspiration when it comes to playing football. FC Barcelona had the privilege of having a player that well in my opinion. Moving back to FC Barcelona, it is a team that I would defend with my soul and I would never stop supporting even if worse comes to worse.</p>
